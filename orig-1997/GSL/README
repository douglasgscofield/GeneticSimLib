GENETIC SIMULATION LIBRARY (GSL)
================================

GSL is a set of C++ classes for incorporating genetics in 
population models.  Source code can be freely copied and 
distributed subject to the constraints spelled out in the
copyright notice at the end of this file and in the file
named COPYRIGHT in this directory.

List of Files
-------------

  README	  this file
  COPYRIGHT	  copyright notice applicable to all source,
		    binary, and documentation files in GSL.
  GSL.html	  main documentation, including design and
		    implementation notes
  GSL.ref.html	  programmer reference pages
  GSL.tar.Z	  source code distribution
  GSL.solaris.*	  Solaris binaries
  GSL.irix.*	  Irix binaries

What to Download
----------------

(1) If you are going to use the library on a machine for 
which there is a binary archive in this directory (e.g. an 
Ultrasparc-1 or later under Solaris 2.5) and you don't want 
to bother compiling the library yourself, download the
appropriate precompiled binary.  This file will also
contain header files.  

(2) If there is not a precompiled binary for your machine, 
or if you plan to use the sources, you need the source 
distribution in GSL.tar.Z.  

(3) If you want a local copy of the documentation, grab 
GSL.doc.tar.Z, or you can just use the Web-based documentation 
at http://www.csi.uoregon.edu/projects/genetics/GSL.


Installation
------------

(1) Download the files you need (as described above).

(2) Move the files to a directory where you want to install 
    the software.

(3) Uncompress the .Z files (e.g. type "uncompress GSL.tar.Z").
    Repeat this step for every .Z file you downloaded.

(4) Extract individual files from the tar files.  For example,
    if you downloaded and uncompressed GSL.tar, you now need to
    type  "tar xvf GSL.tar".  Repeat this step for every .tar
    file you downloaded.

    NOTE: the first time you do step 4 tar will create a 
    directory named GSL as a subdirectory of your current 
    working directory.  Subsequent extractions will add to 
    (and maybe overwrite parts of) this new subdirectory.

You should now have a directory named GSL.  Under this 
directory you will find all or some of the following 
subdirectories, depending on which tar files you downloaded:

    src		Contains all the .C files for the classes
		in the class library
    include	The .h files for the class library
    lib		Contains libgen.a, the compiled library
    doc		HTML documentation
    demo	Sources for demo programs

By default the Makefiles for the demos and applications expect
libgen.a to be in the lib subdirectory.  If you download two
or more binary files and untar them, the library in that archive
will overwrite any file that currently exists.  If you want to
have several versions of the binaries for many different machines,
it is up to you to decide how to manage them.  One method is
to make subdirectories under lib, eg. lib/sun and lib/sgi,
and then move libgen.a to the correct subdirectory each time
you extract a binary.  When all your binaries are unpacked, you
can make a symbolic link named libgen.a in the lib directory
and point it toward the default library.

If you downloaded the src directory and want to compile the
library on your own system, cd to src and type 'make".  Now
you can make the demo and application programs by typing "make"
in the demo and apps directories, respectively.  Note that
when you build your own libgen.a, it will be moved to the lib
directory and overwrite anything there.    

The demo directory also contains a file named Makefile.Template
which you can use as a template for building Makefiles for your
own projects (or you can copy macros and rules from this
file to your existing Makefile).  This Makefile will show you
how to direct your C++ compiler and linker to find the GSL
programs so they can be included with your applications.
